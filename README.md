## 2. Introduction

**Brief background on the problem domain:**  
The problem we aim to address is the difficulty in finding DC-specific events using major platforms like Google or Eventbrite. These platforms often return events happening throughout the broader DMV area, which can be inconvenient or irrelevant for users who want to stay within Washington, DC. Our goal is to create a platform that prioritizes events happening only in DC, catering specifically to DC residents. Since DC is highly metro-accessible and walkable, we want to highlight events that are easily reachable ‚Äî whether by foot, bike, or a short bus ride ‚Äî and enhance the sense of community and accessibility for those who live in this beautiful city.

**Motivation behind the project:**  
We aim to develop an application uniquely and exclusively available for DC residents.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

**Who experiences this problem and why it matters:**  
DC residents often struggle to find events that are specifically happening within the city. When using platforms like Google or Eventbrite, users are frequently shown events from the entire DMV area ‚Äî including Maryland and Virginia ‚Äî which can be overwhelming and not always relevant to their needs. This is especially frustrating for people who prefer attending local events. It creates a disconnect between residents and the vibrant community around them. We believe this matters because Washington, DC, is a unique and walkable city with a strong sense of local identity. Our goal is to design an application specifically for DC residents, helping them discover nearby events without the clutter of unrelated listings ‚Äî ultimately making staying connected to their neighborhood and community easier.

---

## 10. Results / Evaluation

- What works well and what doesn‚Äôt  
- User feedback or usability testing (if done)  

---

## 11. Lessons Learned

**Key takeaways from the project:**  
At the beginning of the project, one of our biggest challenges was coordinating team meetings outside of class. With different schedules and commitments, it was difficult for everyone to agree on a consistent meeting time. This made early collaboration and planning harder than expected. We also struggled initially with team communication and alignment, especially when it came to deciding when and how to meet. However, as the project progressed, we became more organized, learned to be flexible, and found tools and times that worked for everyone. This experience taught us the importance of clear communication, planning, and being adaptable when working in a team.

**Skills or concepts learned:**  
Through this project, we gained a variety of technical and collaborative skills. On the technical side, the developers continued to sharpen their coding skills through the usage of Python, HTML, and CSS and became more comfortable using version control systems like GitHub. We developed stronger communication skills on the collaborative side, especially as a team where coordination was initially a challenge. We also learned how to break down large tasks, assign roles effectively, and support each other in both planning and development. Overall, this project gave us hands-on experience with real-world software development practices and teamwork.

## 12. Limitations & Future Work

- Known bugs, incomplete features  
- What could be improved or extended in the future
